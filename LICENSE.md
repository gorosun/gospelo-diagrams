## Preview HTML Output Restrictions

The `preview` command generates HTML files with Base64-embedded icons for internal review purposes.

**INTERNAL USE ONLY**

- Preview HTML files are intended for internal review and AI-assisted editing workflows
- Redistribution of preview HTML files is strictly prohibited
- For distribution, use the standard `render` command which loads icons from CDN

This restriction exists because:
- Preview files embed icon data directly, which may conflict with third-party icon licenses
- Third-party icons have specific redistribution terms that require attribution or prohibit bundling

---

## Usage Notes

- Icons are loaded dynamically from CDN (jsDelivr, GitHub Raw) at runtime
- This software does not bundle or redistribute the icon files
- Users should comply with the respective licenses when using the icons
- For commercial use, please verify each icon's trademark guidelines
